# smart_attendance_system
Overview 
The goal of  project is to develop a smart attendance system leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques. It trains a model using real-time images and develops an interface that marks attendance based on facial recognition. The system is capable of recognizing registered students and marking their attendance automatically when they appear before the camera. If a student's face is not recognized (i.e., not in the trained dataset or database), the system  displays an appropriate message.
